The app is intentionally simple in its design -- tracking three categories: *Active*, *Creative*, and *Productive*.
Inspired by Apple's fitness rings, I wanted to make an app that would encourage me to be creative more often (and also active and productive).

The swirling orbs were made by me in After Effects; all other assets are drawn in SwiftUI.

Features:
- Track 3 categories (ðŸ”´ active, ðŸŸ£ creative, and ðŸŸ¢ productive)
- See your past thirty days with a quick scroll down
- See further back in a calendar view
- Add notes to give your days additional context


I had a lot of fun designing the app; it helped me mark off many creative days.
