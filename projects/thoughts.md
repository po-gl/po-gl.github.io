A GPT-4 thought organizing web app

Try it out at [thoughts.porterglines.com](https://thoughts.porterglines.com)

`Thoughts` is a web app that generates [mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) using OpenAI's GPT API (`gpt-4-turbo`).
Start with a list of thoughts, and OpenAI's [GPT-4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4) model will connect the ideas and extend the map with related topics.
Manipulate nodes using a familiar and performant node-based editor built using the [React Flow library](https://reactflow.dev).
Organize your thoughts, explore new topics through generation, and break down complex ideas and associations.

Features:
- Automatically generate mind maps using OpenAI's GPT API (`gpt-4-turbo`)
- Add a list of thoughts for the model to start from
- Organize and manipulate nodes with a familiar node-based editor
- View GPT's justification for associations
