PomoBerry is a focus timer app that facilitates the Pomodoro technique. The technique was developed and expanded upon in the 80s and 90s by Francesco Cirillo to enhance focus, increase decision awareness, boost motivation, and alleviate mental fatigue and anxiety, among other goals. The method is simple:

* Work for 25 minutes.
* Rest for 5 minutes.
* Repeat the work-rest process four times.
* Take a longer 15-30 minute break.

Taking regular, scheduled breaks and working for uninterrupted time blocks can enhance focus and alleviate fatigue. However, this is only part of Pomodoro; another important aspect is to:
* Write down a list of tasks to do that day.
* Estimate how many Pomodoros (work-rest blocks) each task will need.
* Record how many actual Pomodoros each task took.

By estimating and recording the number of Pomodoros for tasks, you start to improve your ability to predict how long tasks take, a valuable skill for almost every occupation. PomoBerry aims to be an all-encompassing app for the Pomodoro technique with features that facilitate the aspects described above and more.
