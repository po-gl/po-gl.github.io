I'm a software developer and recent Master's graduate from Idaho State University. I subscribe to the idea of coding as a craft.

I've been an author of four published research [papers]({% link publications.md %}). The topic of the research is models for constrained sequence generation which falls under the umbrella of computational creativity and intelligence.

Lately, I've been working on personal iOS/macOS/watchOS apps, including a timer/tasks app that facilitates Francesco Cirillo's Pomodoro technique, a daily tracker/journaling app, and a ChatGPT dialog app â€” all hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username | escape }}).

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me in the mountains snowboarding, mountain biking, or backpacking.
