I'm a software developer and Idaho State University master's graduate. I subscribe to the idea of coding as a craft.

I've authored four published research [papers]({% link publications.md %}) on machine learning models for constrained sequence generation.

Lately, I've been working on personal web and iOS/macOS/watchOS apps, including a focus timer app that models Francesco Cirillo's Pomodoro technique, a mind map-generating web app (MERN stack), a daily tracker/journaling app, and a ChatGPT dialog appâ€”all hosted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.github_username | escape }}). I've also been learning Go, parallel programming, and distributed systems, with a preference for the Pragmatic Programmers' textbooks.

When I'm not in front of a computer, I'm in the mountains snowboarding, mountain biking, or backpacking.
