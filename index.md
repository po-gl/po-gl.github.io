Hello, I'm a software developer, graduate student, and CS research assistant at Idaho State University. I subscribe to the idea of treating code as a craft.

I have been an author for four published research [papers]({% link publications.md %}). The topic of the research is constrained models for sequence generation and falls into the field of computational creativity and intelligence.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me in the mountains snowboarding, mountain biking, or backpacking.

You can find more details in my [resume]({% link /assets/Porter_Glines_Resume.pdf %}) or you can [contact]({% link contact.md %}) me for any questions.
