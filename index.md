I'm a software developer and recent Master's graduate from Idaho State University. I subscribe to the idea of coding as a craft.

I've been an author for four published research [papers]({% link publications.md %}). The topic of the research is models for constrained sequence generation which falls under the umbrella of computational creativity and intelligence.

When I'm not in front of a computer, you can find me in the mountains snowboarding, mountain biking, or backpacking.

You can find more details in my [resume]({% link /assets/Resume_Porter_Glines.pdf %}) or you can [contact]({% link contact.md %}) me for any questions.
